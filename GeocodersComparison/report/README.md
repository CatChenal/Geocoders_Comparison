# Comparison of Four Geocoders: Nominatim, GoogleV3, ArcGis and AzureMaps

I've implemented the "sliderReport.html" by modifying a ["JS-less CSS slider"](https://github.com/drygiel/csslider) designed by GH user drygiel"

Thank you, drygiel!

There is this glitch, tough:  

I've tried linking to images and frames using relative and absolute address, but the result is the same, the images or frames are not rendered.
